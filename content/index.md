Welcome to REVAN's LogBook, the ultimate solution to a problem I’ve been dodging for years: documenting my shit. For as long as I can remember, my friends have been saying, “Revan, you never write down your ideas. How do you expect to rule the world if you forget half your plans by lunchtime?” Well, guess what, amigos: here it is. The LogBook. A beautiful mix of sarcasm, ambition, and just enough organization to scare my past self.
