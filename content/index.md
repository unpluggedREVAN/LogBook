title: 🌍 Welcome to this LogBook
---

*Because dominating the world starts with taking notes.*

Welcome to **REVAN's LogBook**, the solution to a problem I’ve been dodging for years: documenting my shit.  
For as long as I can remember, my friends have been saying:  
> *"You don't use social media, you are not documenting your ideas or moments. How do you expect to rule the world if you forget half your plans by lunchtime?"*  

Well, here it is: **The LogBook**. A beautiful mix of sarcasm, ambition, and just enough organization to scare my past self.  

Starting from **December 8, 2024**.

## ✨ What the Hell Is This?  
This LogBook is my bluerprint of the everyday. It’s where I:  

- Document my **daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly progress** toward world domination (or, at the very least, my personal goals).  
- Keep track of **projects**, **random ideas**, and those *“Eureka!” moments* that would otherwise disappear into the void.
- Build the foundation of the **REVAN Project**, my life’s grand experiment to become the **best (and most powerful)** version of myself.  
- Prove to myself (and my friends, and you reading this) that I can *actually* keep track of my progress without giving up in a week.  

And let’s not forget the real reason this exists:  
To remind **future Revan** how cool **current Revan** is.

## 🧠 **The Philosophy**  
- **Life throws curveballs.** This LogBook exists to document how I don’t just endure difficulty—I *use it*. Every tough moment is an opportunity for growth, and every obstacle is another step toward power.  
- **Ideas are messy, plans change, and success isn’t linear.** By documenting it all, I impose structure on the madness and make chaos work for me.  
- If I fail or die tomorrow, this LogBook will live on as my **manifesto**. A record of how one person dreamed, failed, laughed, learned, and tried to change the world.

## 🎥 **About the YouTube Channel**  
The LogBook doesn’t exist in a vacuum. The **YouTube channel** is the counterpart where I document whatever the hell I feel like:  

- **Project updates.**  
- **Unhinged ideas.**  
- **Random thoughts at 2 a.m.**  

If the LogBook is the serious sibling, the YouTube channel is the one who shows up late to family dinner.

## 🌌 **The REVAN Project**  
At the core of everything is the **REVAN Project**, where I:  

- Build the **best version of myself** (physically, mentally, financially, spiritually, and, yes, politically).  
- Achieve **every goal I dream of**, no matter how big or crazy.  
- Gain the **power to do whatever I want, whenever I want**, without asking anyone’s permission.
